In this study, Ethernet at gigabit speed is tested as a network for such system. The use of Ethernet helps integrating real-time control functions and non-real-time entertainment functions. Two main scenarios were simulated using {OPNET.} The fist one simulates pure control networks on board of a moving vehicle. The second scenario is the same as the first one with an added video load to simulate on-board entertainment. Both simulations were successful, as the end-to-end delays were below the maximum round-trip delays required by the system},

This paper contributes a competitive analysis of {FlexRay} and time-triggered Ethernet. By showing that it is possible to transfer a fully utilized {FlexRay} system to a system based on time-triggered Ethernet, it is demonstrated that time-triggered Ethernet is a suitable replacement of current in-vehicle bus-systems. Further it is shown that a switched system has advantages in bandwidth utilization over a shared bus, when using group communication.},

                  At the same time, high additional demands for future in-car
                  communication systems are emerging from chassis control,
                  camera based driver assistance and infotainment that cannot

                  towards a flexible highly scalable in-car network is
                  real-time Ethernet. In this paper we discuss the upcoming
                  requirements and argue why current in-car network designs
                  are not suitable for future tasks. By demonstrating how a
                  camera based time-critical driver assistance application
                  can be integrated into a real-time Ethernet based in-car

It became also attractive for several other fields of application like industry, avionics, automotive and telecommunication. The prolonged application of this technology is principally due to its considerable assets like reduced cost, expandability and flexibility. However, Ethernet has been improved to fulfill with the specific conditions of several application fields, mainly in automotive context, is our first purpose. This paper provides firstly a general overview of Ethernet in the automotive field (especially on diagnosis process) comparing it to earliest automotive networks. Then, we will present {CableFish}, our optimized and high performance network analyzer. {CableFish} gives a real time analysis for all packets circulating between several {ECUs} (without loss) and allows in-car diagnosis due to the newly added {HSFZ} protocol.},

There is increasing interest in passive monitoring obeying to high-bandwidth requirements. In order to decipher how to place monitors under cost-effective and real-time constraints within the network, a new approach is presented in this paper, which solves the problem of monitoring high bitrates and convenes three often-conflicting requirements. The first is supporting high bitrates (over 400 megabytes per second), and hence huge system throughputs. The second is opening a gigabyte file (over 100 Gigabytes) while insuring the real-time analysis of its data, and the third is running only one off-the-shelf and cost-effective computer. The monitoring and analysis chore in our system allows online and offline analysis. Its challenging task is collecting and analyzing such huge data on real-time using a centralized processing architecture.},

	abstract = {This paper discusses novel communication network topologies and components and describes an evolutionary path of bringing Ethernet into automotive applications with focus on electric mobility. For next generation in-vehicle networking, the automotive industry identified Ethernet as a promising candidate besides {CAN} and {FlexRay}. Ethernet is an {IEEE} standard and is broadly used in consumer and industry domains. It will bring a number of changes for the design and management of in-vehicle networks and provides significant re-use of components, software, and tools. Ethernet is intended to connect inside the vehicle high-speed communication requiring sub-systems like Advanced Driver Assistant Systems ({ADAS}), navigation and positioning, multimedia, and connectivity systems. For hybrid ({HEVs}) or electric vehicles ({EVs}), Ethernet will be a powerful part of the communication architecture layer that enables the link between the vehicle electronics and the Internet where the vehicle is a part of a typical Internet of Things ({IoT}) application. Using Ethernet for vehicle connectivity will effectively manage the huge amount of data to be transferred between the outside world and the vehicle through vehicle-to-x (V2V and V2I or V2I+I) communication systems and cloud-based services for advanced energy management solutions. Ethernet is an enabling technology for introducing advanced features into the automotive domain and needs further optimizations in terms of scalability, cost, power, and electrical robustness in order to be adopted and widely used by the industry.},

	abstract = {Ethernet technology is widely used in real-time industrial automation. Thanks to real-time Ethernet ({RTE}) protocols, defined in {IEC}61784-2 standard, new top-performance automation solutions can be created. Such systems may have communication cycle time down to tens of mus and cycle jitter less than 1 mus, making network testing and debugging very critical. Existing network and protocol analyzers can perform detailed local analysis, but characterization of high-performance {RTE} systems requires measurement of transmission delays and these instruments cannot be adequately synchronized among them to realize a distributed measurement network. This paper introduces a new low-cost distributed measurement instrument to measure timing characteristics of {RTE} nodes (end-to-end delays, synchronization, etc.). The proposed instrument has multiple {FPGA}-based probes that allow for simultaneous/synchronized logging on different place of the target {RTE} network. A {PC}-based "monitor station" stores all the data, ready for further elaboration. Architecture details are discussed, a prototype has been realized, and some experimental results are presented. For instance, synchronization accuracy between probes is below 100 ns.},

For delay jitter, where the goal is to minimize the difference between delay times of different packets, we show that a simple on-line algorithm using a buffer of B slots guarantees the same delay jitter as the best off-line algorithm using buffer space B/2. We prove that the guarantees made by our on-line algorithm hold, even for simple distributed implementations, where the total buffer space is distributed along the path of the connection, provided that the input stream satisfies a certain simple property. For rate jitter, where the goal is to minimize the difference between inter-arrival times, we develop an on-line algorithm using a buffer of size 2B + h for any h ≥ 1, and compare its jitter to the jitter of an optimal off-line algorithm using buffer size B. We prove that our algorithm guarantees that the difference is bounded by a term proportional to B/h.},

In this paper, we use modeling, measurements, and simulations to better characterize the interaction between probing packets and the competing network traffic. We first construct a simple model to understand how competing traffic changes the probing packet gap for a single-hop network. The gap model shows that the initial probing gap is a critical parameter when using packet pairs to estimate available bandwidth. Based on this insight, we present two available bandwidth measurement techniques, the initial gap increasing (IGI) method and the packet transmission rate (PTR) method. We use extensive Internet measurements to show that these techniques estimate available bandwidth faster than existing techniques such as Pathload, with comparable accuracy. Finally, using both Internet measurements and ns simulations, we explore how the measurement accuracy of active probing is affected by factors such as the probing packet size, the length of probing packet train, and the competing traffic on links other than the tight link.},

	abstract = {Automotive architectures today consist of up to 100 electronic control units (ECUs) that communicate via one or more FlexRay and CAN buses. Multiple control applications - like cruise control, brake control, etc. are specified as Simulink/Stateflow models, from which code is generated and mapped onto the different ECUs. In addition, scheduling policies and parameters, both for the ECUs and the buses, need to be specified. Code generation/optimization from the Simulink/Stateflow models, task partitioning and mapping decisions, as well as the parameters chosen for the schedulers all of these impact the execution times and timing behaviour of the control tasks and control messages. These in turn affect control performance, such as stability and steady-/transient-state behaviour. This paper discusses different aspects of this multi-layered design flow and the associated research challenges. The emphasis is on model-based code generation, analysis, testing and verification of control software for automotive architectures, as well as on architecture or platform configuration to ensure that the required control performance requirements are satisfied.},

Rather than hide the underlying scenegraph within a toolkit-specific abstraction, D3 enables direct inspection and manipulation of a native representation: the standard document object model (DOM). With D3, designers selectively bind input data to arbitrary document elements, applying dynamic transforms to both generate and modify content. We show how representational transparency improves expressiveness and better integrates with developer tools than prior approaches, while offering comparable notational efficiency and retaining powerful declarative components. Immediate evaluation of operators further simplifies debugging and allows iterative development. Additionally, we demonstrate how D3 transforms naturally enable animation and interaction with dramatic performance improvements over intermediate representations.},

These scenarios distinguish different study goals and types of research questions and are illustrated through example studies. Through this broad survey and the distillation of these scenarios, we make two contributions. One, we encapsulate the current practices in the information visualization research community and, two, we provide a different approach to reaching decisions about what might be the most effective evaluation of a given information visualization. Scenarios can be used to choose appropriate research questions and goals and the provided examples can be consulted for guidance on how to design one's own study.},

Our goal is to reflect on a meta-level about evaluation in our community through a systematic understanding of the characteristics and goals of presented evaluations. For this purpose we conducted a systematic review of ten years of evaluations in the published papers using and extending a coding scheme previously established by Lam et al. [2012]. The results of our review include an overview of the most common evaluation goals in the community, how they evolved over time, and how they contrast or align to those of the IEEE Information Visualization conference. In particular, we found that evaluations specific to assessing resulting images and algorithm performance are the most prevalent (with consistently 80-90\% of all papers since 1997). However, especially over the last six years there is a steady increase in evaluation methods that include participants, either by evaluating their performances and subjective feedback or by evaluating their work practices and their improved analysis and reasoning capabilities using visual tools. Up to 2010, this trend in the IEEE Visualization conference was much more pronounced than in the IEEE Information Visualization conference which only showed an increasing percentage of evaluation through user performance and experience testing. Since 2011, however, also papers in IEEE Information Visualization show such an increase of evaluations of work practices and analysis as well as reasoning using visual tools. Further, we found that generally the studies reporting requirements analyses and domain-specific work practices are too informally reported which hinders cross-comparison and lowers external validity.},

As a starting point, I will give an overview of the scope of the DESMET methodology in this article and describe the nine different evaluation methods DESMET identified.

Your particular choice of evaluation method will be affected by your evaluation goals, the characteristics of the object you want to evaluate, the characteristics of the organisation you work in, and the limitations and constraints placed on the evaluation exercise. These different factors interact in complicated ways, so it is difficult to identify which evaluation method is the most appropriate.The specific criteria that the DESMET methodology uses to determine your circumstances are:1. The evaluation context.2. The nature of the expected impact of using the method/tool.3. The nature of the object (i.e., method/tool/generic method) to be evaluated.4. The scope of impact of the method/tool.5. The maturity of the method/tool.6. The learning curve associated with the method/tool.7.

In principle, you should select the simplest evaluation method appropriate for your specific evaluation requirements and organisational capability. However there are a number of constraints that can influence your final choice of evaluation method:\&bull; the elapsed time that is needed for the different evaluation options;\&bull; the confidence that a user can have in the results of an evaluation;\&bull; the cost of an evaluation;This information may be useful in two circumstances:1. When you want to decide between a quantitative case study and a quantitative formal experiment and there are no clear technical reasons for preferring one to the other.2.

Meanwhile, Ethernet continues to evolve also in its native standardization body, the IEEE. In particular, Ethernet grows in two directions, speed and services, and we consider two specific developments to be of particular interest to the avionics industry. First, the 1000BASE-T1 PHY Task Force (IEEE P802.3bp) and the IEEE 100BASE-T1 Task Force (IEEE 802.3bw) are standardizing Ethernet PHYs considering usage in harsh environments like industrial or automotive at Gbit/sec and 100 Mbit/sec transmission speeds. Secondly, the time-sensitive networking task group (IEEE 802.1 TSN) is currently standardizing basic forms of time-triggered communication to minimize the transmission latency and jitter of Ethernet. In this paper we give an overview of the current developments in IEEE 802.3bp, IEEE 802.3bw and IEEE 802.1 TSN and formulate a perspective on the future use of Ethernet in avionics systems.},

The term “computer technology” now-a-days includes most technology from obvious computers with screens and keyboards to mobile phones, household appliances, in-car navigation systems and even embedded sensors and actuators such as automatic lighting. HCI has an associated design discipline, sometimes called Interaction Design or User-Centered Design, focused on how to design computer technology so that it is as easy and pleasant to use as possible.

We attack this problem in the context of bringing the theoretical ideas within a model of exploratory learning [19] to bear on the evaluation of alternative interfaces for walk-up-and-use systems. We derived a “cognitive walkthrough” procedure for systematically evaluating features of an interface in the context of the theory. Four people independently applied this procedure to four alternative interfaces for which we have empirical usability data. Consideration of the walkthrough sheds light on the consistency with which such a procedure can be applied as well as the accuracy of the results.},

This can be achieved by performing usability evaluations in the product development process to detect and mitigate potential usability problems. A commonly used method is cognitive walkthrough (CW), but this method shows three weaknesses: poor high-level perspective, insufficient categorisation of detected usability problems, and difficulties in overviewing the analytical results. This paper presents a further development of CW with the aim of overcoming its weaknesses. The new method is called enhanced cognitive walkthrough (ECW). ECW is a proactive analytical method for analysis of potential usability problems. The ECW method has been employed to evaluate user interface designs of medical equipment such as home-care ventilators, infusion pumps, dialysis machines, and insulin pumps. The method has proved capable of identifying several potential use problems in designs.},

For the first time, small teams of professional developers have used this method to critique three complex software systems.

We focus on five core issues: (1) task selection, coverage, and evaluation, (2) the process of doing a Cognitive Walkthrough, (3) requisite knowlege for the evaluators, (4) group walkthroughs, and (5) the interpretation of results. Our findings show that many variables can affect the success of the technique; we believe that if the Cognitive Walkthrough is ultimately to be successful in industrial settings, the method must be refined and augmented in a variety of ways.},

	abstract = {In information visualization, evaluation plays a crucial role during the development of a new visualization technique. In recent years, eye tracking has become one means to analyze how users perceive and understand a new visualization system. Since most visualizations are highly interactive nowadays, a study should take interaction, in terms of user-input, into account as well. In addition, think aloud data gives insights into cognitive processes of participants using a visualization system. Typically, researchers evaluate these data sources separately. However, we think it is beneficial to correlate eye tracking, interaction, and think aloud data for deeper analyses. In this paper, we present challenges and possible solutions in triangulating user behavior using multiple evaluation data sources. We describe how the data is collected, synchronized, and analyzed using a string-based and a visualization-based approach founded on experiences from our current research. We suggest methods how to tackle these issues and discuss benefits and disadvantages. Thus, the contribution of our work is twofold. On the one hand, we present our approach and the experiences we gained during our research. On the other hand, we investigate additional methods that can be used to analyze this multi-source data.},

	abstract = {Thinking-aloud protocols traditionally have been used by academic researchers as a qualitative data collection method. This method is currently gaining acceptance in industry usability testing. The Usability Group at Microsoft has adopted the thinking-aloud protocol as a primary method for obtaining data from users. We have found the method valuable not only because it is valid for gathering qualitative data, but also because it is responsive to the constraints we face and the organizational culture we work within. The issue of validity has been discussed in detail by researchers such as Deffner \& Rhenius and Ericcson \& Simon. Our case study further pursues the validity of thinking-aloud protocols and also discusses how this method allows the researcher to work within industry constraints and incorporate changes into the product within a small time frame. Finally, our case study demonstrates how thinking-aloud protocols fit in well with Microsoft corporate culture where understandable and persuasive results are needed. This case study will have particular relevance for usability practitioners in industry.},

With quantitative evaluation costs and detection values, the model can estimate the numbers of evaluations at which optimal cost/benefit ratios are obtained and at which marginal utility vanishes. For a “medium” example, we estimate that 16 evaluations would be worth their cost, with maximum benefit/cost ratio at four.},

Designers of these systems must make a variety of design decisions, ranging from determining layout to constructing sophisticated coordination mechanisms. Surprisingly, little work has been done to characterize these systems or to express guidelines for their design.

Often, patterns in such data evolve over time among multiple dimensions and are hard to detect. Dimensionality reduction methods such as PCA and MDS allow analysis and visualization of multivariate data, but per se do not provide means to explore multivariate patterns over time. We propose Temporal Multidimensional Scaling (TMDS), a novel visualization technique that computes temporal one-dimensional MDS plots for multivariate data which evolve over time. Using a sliding window approach, MDS is computed for each data window separately, and the results are plotted sequentially along the time axis, taking care of plot alignment. Our TMDS plots enable visual identification of patterns based on multidimensional similarity of the data evolving over time. We demonstrate the usefulness of our approach in the field of network security and show in two case studies how users can iteratively explore the data to identify previously unknown, temporally evolving patterns.},

In this article, the authors therefore propose a generalization of traditional bar charts and x-y plots, which allows the visualization of large amounts of data. The basic idea is to use the pixels within the bars to present detailed information of the data records. The so-called pixel bar charts retain the intuitiveness of traditional bar charts while allowing very large data sets to be visualized in an effective way. It is shown that, for an effective pixel placement, a complex optimization problem has to be solved. The authors then present an algorithm which efficiently solves the problem. The application to a number of real-world e-commerce data sets shows the wide applicability and usefulness of this new idea, and a comparison to other well-known visualization techniques (parallel coordinates and spiral techniques) shows a number of clear advantages.},

In this paper, we propose a new visualization technique called `recursive pattern' which has been developed for visualizing large amounts of multidimensional data. The technique is based on a generic recursive scheme which generalizes a wide range of pixel-oriented arrangements for displaying large data sets. By instantiating the technique with adequate data- and application-dependent parameters, the user may largely influence the structure of the resulting visualizations. Since the technique uses one pixel for presenting each data value, the amount of data which can be displayed is only limited by the resolution of current display technology and by the limitations of human perceptibility. Beside describing the basic idea of the `recursive pattern' technique, we provide several examples of useful parameter settings for the various recursion levels. We further show that our `recursive pattern ' technique is particularly advantageous for the large class of data sets which have a natural order according to one dimension (e.g. time series data). We demonstrate the usefulness of our technique by using a stock market application.},

Of equal importance is the ability to control the viewing parameters, so that one can interactively adjust what ranges of values each dimension takes and the form in which the dimensions are displayed. This will allow an intuitive feel for the data to be developed as the database is explored. The system uses dimensional stacking, to collapse and N-dimension space down into a 2-D space and then render the values contained therein.

This representation converts sequential data of varying lengths to high dimensional histogram vectors which are easily modeled by standard statistical models. Unfortunately, the histogram representation ignores most of the medium and long range sequential dependencies making it unsuitable for visualizing sequential data. We present a novel framework for sequential visualization of discrete categorical time series based on the idea of local statistical modeling. The framework embeds categorical time series as smooth curves in the multinomial simplex summarizing the progression of sequential trends. We discuss several visualization techniques based on the above framework and demonstrate their usefulness for document visualization.},

	abstract = {Time-series data is a common target for visual analytics, as they appear in a wide range of application domains. Typical tasks in analyzing time-series data include identifying cyclic behavior, outliers, trends, and periods of time that share distinctive shape characteristics. Many methods for visualizing time series data exist, generally mapping the data values to positions or colors. While each can be used to perform a subset of the above tasks, none to date is a complete solution. In this paper we present a novel approach to time-series data visualization, namely creating multivariate data records out of short subsequences of the data and then using multivariate visualization methods to display and explore the data in the resulting shape space. We borrow ideas from text analysis, where the use of N-grams is a common approach to decomposing and processing unstructured text. By mapping each temporal N-gram to a glyph, and then positioning the glyphs via PCA (basically a projection in shape space), many different kinds of patterns in the sequence can be readily identified. Interactive selection via brushing, in conjunction with linking to other visualizations, provides a wide range of tools for exploring the data. We validate the usefulness of this approach with examples from several application domains and tasks, comparing our methods with traditional time-series visualizations.},

	abstract = {The analysis of time-dependent data is an important problem in many application domains, and interactive visualization of time-series data can help in understanding patterns in large time series data. Many effective approaches already exist for visual analysis of univariate time series supporting tasks such as assessment of data quality, detection of outliers, or identification of periodically or frequently occurring patterns. However, much fewer approaches exist which support multivariate time series. The existence of multiple values per time stamp makes the analysis task per se harder, and existing visualization techniques often do not scale well. We introduce an approach for visual analysis of large multivariate time-dependent data, based on the idea of projecting multivariate measurements to a 2D display, visualizing the time dimension by trajectories. We use visual data aggregation metaphors based on grouping of similar data elements to scale with multivariate time series. Aggregation procedures can either be based on statistical properties of the data or on data clustering routines. Appropriately defined user controls allow to navigate and explore the data and interactively steer the parameters of the data aggregation to enhance data analysis. We present an implementation of our approach and apply it on a comprehensive data set from the field of earth observation, demonstrating the applicability and usefulness of our approach.},

Time curves employ the metaphor of folding a timeline visualization into itself so as to bring similar time points close to each other.

We illustrate how time curves can visually reveal informative patterns in a range of different datasets.},

MultiPiles is based on the physical analogy of piling adjacency matrices, each one representing a single temporal snapshot. Common interfaces for visualizing dynamic networks use techniques such as: flipping/animation; small multiples; or summary views in isolation. Our proposed ‘piling’ metaphor presents a hybrid of these techniques, leveraging each one's advantages, as well as offering the ability to scale to networks with hundreds of temporal snapshots. While the MultiPiles technique is applicable to many domains, our prototype was initially designed to help neuroscientists investigate changes in brain connectivity networks over several hundred snapshots. The piling metaphor and associated interaction and visual encodings allowed neuroscientists to explore their data, prior to a statistical analysis. They detected high-level temporal patterns in individual networks and this helped them to formulate and reject several hypotheses.},

	abstract = {A timing chain drive transfers motion from the engine's crankshaft to the camshaft that operates the valves. The design process of timing chain drives involves computer simulation of many design variants in order to find an optimum. Most of the simulation results can be represented as families of function graphs (data series). Previously, the analysis of those results was based on static 2D diagrams and animated 3D visualizations. They were suitable for the detailed analysis of a few simulation variants, but not for the comparison of many cases. In this paper we propose a new approach to the analysis based on coordinated linked views and advanced brushing features. Our proposed method supports the interactive analysis of many design variants. We introduce a novel view, called segmented curve view, which can display distributions in families of function graphs. The segmented curve view combines individual function graphs where for a fixed value of the independent variable, a bar extends from minimum to maximum values across the family of function graphs. Each bar is divided into segments (bins) with a color that represents the number of function graphs with the value in that segment. In the case study, we demonstrate that the new view combined with "traditional" views provides a strong support for the interactive visual exploration and analysis of a real world timing chain design problem.},
