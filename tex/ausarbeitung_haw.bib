In this study, Ethernet at gigabit speed is tested as a network for such system. The use of Ethernet helps integrating real-time control functions and non-real-time entertainment functions. Two main scenarios were simulated using {OPNET.} The fist one simulates pure control networks on board of a moving vehicle. The second scenario is the same as the first one with an added video load to simulate on-board entertainment. Both simulations were successful, as the end-to-end delays were below the maximum round-trip delays required by the system},

This paper contributes a competitive analysis of {FlexRay} and time-triggered Ethernet. By showing that it is possible to transfer a fully utilized {FlexRay} system to a system based on time-triggered Ethernet, it is demonstrated that time-triggered Ethernet is a suitable replacement of current in-vehicle bus-systems. Further it is shown that a switched system has advantages in bandwidth utilization over a shared bus, when using group communication.},

                  At the same time, high additional demands for future in-car
                  communication systems are emerging from chassis control,
                  camera based driver assistance and infotainment that cannot

                  towards a flexible highly scalable in-car network is
                  real-time Ethernet. In this paper we discuss the upcoming
                  requirements and argue why current in-car network designs
                  are not suitable for future tasks. By demonstrating how a
                  camera based time-critical driver assistance application
                  can be integrated into a real-time Ethernet based in-car

It became also attractive for several other fields of application like industry, avionics, automotive and telecommunication. The prolonged application of this technology is principally due to its considerable assets like reduced cost, expandability and flexibility. However, Ethernet has been improved to fulfill with the specific conditions of several application fields, mainly in automotive context, is our first purpose. This paper provides firstly a general overview of Ethernet in the automotive field (especially on diagnosis process) comparing it to earliest automotive networks. Then, we will present {CableFish}, our optimized and high performance network analyzer. {CableFish} gives a real time analysis for all packets circulating between several {ECUs} (without loss) and allows in-car diagnosis due to the newly added {HSFZ} protocol.},

There is increasing interest in passive monitoring obeying to high-bandwidth requirements. In order to decipher how to place monitors under cost-effective and real-time constraints within the network, a new approach is presented in this paper, which solves the problem of monitoring high bitrates and convenes three often-conflicting requirements. The first is supporting high bitrates (over 400 megabytes per second), and hence huge system throughputs. The second is opening a gigabyte file (over 100 Gigabytes) while insuring the real-time analysis of its data, and the third is running only one off-the-shelf and cost-effective computer. The monitoring and analysis chore in our system allows online and offline analysis. Its challenging task is collecting and analyzing such huge data on real-time using a centralized processing architecture.},

	abstract = {This paper discusses novel communication network topologies and components and describes an evolutionary path of bringing Ethernet into automotive applications with focus on electric mobility. For next generation in-vehicle networking, the automotive industry identified Ethernet as a promising candidate besides {CAN} and {FlexRay}. Ethernet is an {IEEE} standard and is broadly used in consumer and industry domains. It will bring a number of changes for the design and management of in-vehicle networks and provides significant re-use of components, software, and tools. Ethernet is intended to connect inside the vehicle high-speed communication requiring sub-systems like Advanced Driver Assistant Systems ({ADAS}), navigation and positioning, multimedia, and connectivity systems. For hybrid ({HEVs}) or electric vehicles ({EVs}), Ethernet will be a powerful part of the communication architecture layer that enables the link between the vehicle electronics and the Internet where the vehicle is a part of a typical Internet of Things ({IoT}) application. Using Ethernet for vehicle connectivity will effectively manage the huge amount of data to be transferred between the outside world and the vehicle through vehicle-to-x (V2V and V2I or V2I+I) communication systems and cloud-based services for advanced energy management solutions. Ethernet is an enabling technology for introducing advanced features into the automotive domain and needs further optimizations in terms of scalability, cost, power, and electrical robustness in order to be adopted and widely used by the industry.},

	abstract = {Ethernet technology is widely used in real-time industrial automation. Thanks to real-time Ethernet ({RTE}) protocols, defined in {IEC}61784-2 standard, new top-performance automation solutions can be created. Such systems may have communication cycle time down to tens of mus and cycle jitter less than 1 mus, making network testing and debugging very critical. Existing network and protocol analyzers can perform detailed local analysis, but characterization of high-performance {RTE} systems requires measurement of transmission delays and these instruments cannot be adequately synchronized among them to realize a distributed measurement network. This paper introduces a new low-cost distributed measurement instrument to measure timing characteristics of {RTE} nodes (end-to-end delays, synchronization, etc.). The proposed instrument has multiple {FPGA}-based probes that allow for simultaneous/synchronized logging on different place of the target {RTE} network. A {PC}-based "monitor station" stores all the data, ready for further elaboration. Architecture details are discussed, a prototype has been realized, and some experimental results are presented. For instance, synchronization accuracy between probes is below 100 ns.},

For delay jitter, where the goal is to minimize the difference between delay times of different packets, we show that a simple on-line algorithm using a buffer of B slots guarantees the same delay jitter as the best off-line algorithm using buffer space B/2. We prove that the guarantees made by our on-line algorithm hold, even for simple distributed implementations, where the total buffer space is distributed along the path of the connection, provided that the input stream satisfies a certain simple property. For rate jitter, where the goal is to minimize the difference between inter-arrival times, we develop an on-line algorithm using a buffer of size 2B + h for any h ≥ 1, and compare its jitter to the jitter of an optimal off-line algorithm using buffer size B. We prove that our algorithm guarantees that the difference is bounded by a term proportional to B/h.},

In this paper, we use modeling, measurements, and simulations to better characterize the interaction between probing packets and the competing network traffic. We first construct a simple model to understand how competing traffic changes the probing packet gap for a single-hop network. The gap model shows that the initial probing gap is a critical parameter when using packet pairs to estimate available bandwidth. Based on this insight, we present two available bandwidth measurement techniques, the initial gap increasing (IGI) method and the packet transmission rate (PTR) method. We use extensive Internet measurements to show that these techniques estimate available bandwidth faster than existing techniques such as Pathload, with comparable accuracy. Finally, using both Internet measurements and ns simulations, we explore how the measurement accuracy of active probing is affected by factors such as the probing packet size, the length of probing packet train, and the competing traffic on links other than the tight link.},

	abstract = {Automotive architectures today consist of up to 100 electronic control units (ECUs) that communicate via one or more FlexRay and CAN buses. Multiple control applications - like cruise control, brake control, etc. are specified as Simulink/Stateflow models, from which code is generated and mapped onto the different ECUs. In addition, scheduling policies and parameters, both for the ECUs and the buses, need to be specified. Code generation/optimization from the Simulink/Stateflow models, task partitioning and mapping decisions, as well as the parameters chosen for the schedulers all of these impact the execution times and timing behaviour of the control tasks and control messages. These in turn affect control performance, such as stability and steady-/transient-state behaviour. This paper discusses different aspects of this multi-layered design flow and the associated research challenges. The emphasis is on model-based code generation, analysis, testing and verification of control software for automotive architectures, as well as on architecture or platform configuration to ensure that the required control performance requirements are satisfied.},

Rather than hide the underlying scenegraph within a toolkit-specific abstraction, D3 enables direct inspection and manipulation of a native representation: the standard document object model (DOM). With D3, designers selectively bind input data to arbitrary document elements, applying dynamic transforms to both generate and modify content. We show how representational transparency improves expressiveness and better integrates with developer tools than prior approaches, while offering comparable notational efficiency and retaining powerful declarative components. Immediate evaluation of operators further simplifies debugging and allows iterative development. Additionally, we demonstrate how D3 transforms naturally enable animation and interaction with dramatic performance improvements over intermediate representations.},

These scenarios distinguish different study goals and types of research questions and are illustrated through example studies. Through this broad survey and the distillation of these scenarios, we make two contributions. One, we encapsulate the current practices in the information visualization research community and, two, we provide a different approach to reaching decisions about what might be the most effective evaluation of a given information visualization. Scenarios can be used to choose appropriate research questions and goals and the provided examples can be consulted for guidance on how to design one's own study.},

Our goal is to reflect on a meta-level about evaluation in our community through a systematic understanding of the characteristics and goals of presented evaluations. For this purpose we conducted a systematic review of ten years of evaluations in the published papers using and extending a coding scheme previously established by Lam et al. [2012]. The results of our review include an overview of the most common evaluation goals in the community, how they evolved over time, and how they contrast or align to those of the IEEE Information Visualization conference. In particular, we found that evaluations specific to assessing resulting images and algorithm performance are the most prevalent (with consistently 80-90\% of all papers since 1997). However, especially over the last six years there is a steady increase in evaluation methods that include participants, either by evaluating their performances and subjective feedback or by evaluating their work practices and their improved analysis and reasoning capabilities using visual tools. Up to 2010, this trend in the IEEE Visualization conference was much more pronounced than in the IEEE Information Visualization conference which only showed an increasing percentage of evaluation through user performance and experience testing. Since 2011, however, also papers in IEEE Information Visualization show such an increase of evaluations of work practices and analysis as well as reasoning using visual tools. Further, we found that generally the studies reporting requirements analyses and domain-specific work practices are too informally reported which hinders cross-comparison and lowers external validity.},

As a starting point, I will give an overview of the scope of the DESMET methodology in this article and describe the nine different evaluation methods DESMET identified.

Your particular choice of evaluation method will be affected by your evaluation goals, the characteristics of the object you want to evaluate, the characteristics of the organisation you work in, and the limitations and constraints placed on the evaluation exercise. These different factors interact in complicated ways, so it is difficult to identify which evaluation method is the most appropriate.The specific criteria that the DESMET methodology uses to determine your circumstances are:1. The evaluation context.2. The nature of the expected impact of using the method/tool.3. The nature of the object (i.e., method/tool/generic method) to be evaluated.4. The scope of impact of the method/tool.5. The maturity of the method/tool.6. The learning curve associated with the method/tool.7.

In principle, you should select the simplest evaluation method appropriate for your specific evaluation requirements and organisational capability. However there are a number of constraints that can influence your final choice of evaluation method:\&bull; the elapsed time that is needed for the different evaluation options;\&bull; the confidence that a user can have in the results of an evaluation;\&bull; the cost of an evaluation;This information may be useful in two circumstances:1. When you want to decide between a quantitative case study and a quantitative formal experiment and there are no clear technical reasons for preferring one to the other.2.

Meanwhile, Ethernet continues to evolve also in its native standardization body, the IEEE. In particular, Ethernet grows in two directions, speed and services, and we consider two specific developments to be of particular interest to the avionics industry. First, the 1000BASE-T1 PHY Task Force (IEEE P802.3bp) and the IEEE 100BASE-T1 Task Force (IEEE 802.3bw) are standardizing Ethernet PHYs considering usage in harsh environments like industrial or automotive at Gbit/sec and 100 Mbit/sec transmission speeds. Secondly, the time-sensitive networking task group (IEEE 802.1 TSN) is currently standardizing basic forms of time-triggered communication to minimize the transmission latency and jitter of Ethernet. In this paper we give an overview of the current developments in IEEE 802.3bp, IEEE 802.3bw and IEEE 802.1 TSN and formulate a perspective on the future use of Ethernet in avionics systems.},

The term “computer technology” now-a-days includes most technology from obvious computers with screens and keyboards to mobile phones, household appliances, in-car navigation systems and even embedded sensors and actuators such as automatic lighting. HCI has an associated design discipline, sometimes called Interaction Design or User-Centered Design, focused on how to design computer technology so that it is as easy and pleasant to use as possible.

We attack this problem in the context of bringing the theoretical ideas within a model of exploratory learning [19] to bear on the evaluation of alternative interfaces for walk-up-and-use systems. We derived a “cognitive walkthrough” procedure for systematically evaluating features of an interface in the context of the theory. Four people independently applied this procedure to four alternative interfaces for which we have empirical usability data. Consideration of the walkthrough sheds light on the consistency with which such a procedure can be applied as well as the accuracy of the results.},

This can be achieved by performing usability evaluations in the product development process to detect and mitigate potential usability problems. A commonly used method is cognitive walkthrough (CW), but this method shows three weaknesses: poor high-level perspective, insufficient categorisation of detected usability problems, and difficulties in overviewing the analytical results. This paper presents a further development of CW with the aim of overcoming its weaknesses. The new method is called enhanced cognitive walkthrough (ECW). ECW is a proactive analytical method for analysis of potential usability problems. The ECW method has been employed to evaluate user interface designs of medical equipment such as home-care ventilators, infusion pumps, dialysis machines, and insulin pumps. The method has proved capable of identifying several potential use problems in designs.},

For the first time, small teams of professional developers have used this method to critique three complex software systems.

We focus on five core issues: (1) task selection, coverage, and evaluation, (2) the process of doing a Cognitive Walkthrough, (3) requisite knowlege for the evaluators, (4) group walkthroughs, and (5) the interpretation of results. Our findings show that many variables can affect the success of the technique; we believe that if the Cognitive Walkthrough is ultimately to be successful in industrial settings, the method must be refined and augmented in a variety of ways.},

	abstract = {In information visualization, evaluation plays a crucial role during the development of a new visualization technique. In recent years, eye tracking has become one means to analyze how users perceive and understand a new visualization system. Since most visualizations are highly interactive nowadays, a study should take interaction, in terms of user-input, into account as well. In addition, think aloud data gives insights into cognitive processes of participants using a visualization system. Typically, researchers evaluate these data sources separately. However, we think it is beneficial to correlate eye tracking, interaction, and think aloud data for deeper analyses. In this paper, we present challenges and possible solutions in triangulating user behavior using multiple evaluation data sources. We describe how the data is collected, synchronized, and analyzed using a string-based and a visualization-based approach founded on experiences from our current research. We suggest methods how to tackle these issues and discuss benefits and disadvantages. Thus, the contribution of our work is twofold. On the one hand, we present our approach and the experiences we gained during our research. On the other hand, we investigate additional methods that can be used to analyze this multi-source data.},

	abstract = {Thinking-aloud protocols traditionally have been used by academic researchers as a qualitative data collection method. This method is currently gaining acceptance in industry usability testing. The Usability Group at Microsoft has adopted the thinking-aloud protocol as a primary method for obtaining data from users. We have found the method valuable not only because it is valid for gathering qualitative data, but also because it is responsive to the constraints we face and the organizational culture we work within. The issue of validity has been discussed in detail by researchers such as Deffner \& Rhenius and Ericcson \& Simon. Our case study further pursues the validity of thinking-aloud protocols and also discusses how this method allows the researcher to work within industry constraints and incorporate changes into the product within a small time frame. Finally, our case study demonstrates how thinking-aloud protocols fit in well with Microsoft corporate culture where understandable and persuasive results are needed. This case study will have particular relevance for usability practitioners in industry.},

	abstract = {For 11 studies, we find that the detection of usability problems as a function of number of users tested or heuristic evaluators employed is well modeled as a Poisson process. The model can be used to plan the amount of evaluation required to achieve desired levels of thoroughness or benefits. Results of early tests can provide estimates of the number of problems left to be found and the number of additional evaluations needed to find a given fraction. With quantitative evaluation costs and detection values, the model can estimate the numbers of evaluations at which optimal cost/benefit ratios are obtained and at which marginal utility vanishes. For a “medium” example, we estimate that 16 evaluations would be worth their cost, with maximum benefit/cost ratio at four.},
